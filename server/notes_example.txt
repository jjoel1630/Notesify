Section 1.1: Systems of Linear Equations

Definitions
Linear equation
a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + … + aₙxₙ = b
Organization of coefficients and variables with a solution ‘b’

System of linear equations
Collection of multiple linear equations

Solution of a system
(s₁, s₂, … ,sₙ)
List of numbers that make each equation a true statement when the s values are substituted for the x variables

Solution set
Set of all possible solutions of a linear system

Equivalent linear systems
2 linear systems with the same solution set

Consistent system
1 solution or infinitely many solutions

Inconsistent system
No solution for a specific input

Existence
Does a solution set exist?

Uniqueness
If a solution exists, is there more than one solution?

Key Notes
A system of linear equations has either:
No solution
Exactly one solution
Infinitely many solutions

Matrix notation
Rectangular format that contains info of a linear system

Example system
1x₁ - 2x₂ + x₃ = 0
0x₁ + 2x₂ - 8x₃ = 8
5x₁ + 0x₂ - 5x₃ = 10

Coefficient matrix

Augmented matrix

Size of a matrix
m x n
m: rows
n: columns

Row reduction operations
Replacement
Eliminating elements (making them 0) by comparing two rows and scaling one of them
Interchange
Swapping rows
Scaling
Usually done to make a leading entry into one

Goal of row reduction: to create an echelon form or RREF
Triangle of 0’s

Section 1.2: Row Reduction and Echelon Forms

Definitions
Non-zero row/column
Row or column with at least one nonzero entry

Zero row/column
Row or column with all zeros

Leading entry
Leftmost nonzero entry in a row

Row reduced echelon form (RREF)
A simplified matrix that represents a potential solution set for a linear system
Each matrix has only one RREF

Pivot position
Location in a matrix that corresponds to a leading 1 in RREF

Pivot column
Column that contains a pivot position

Basic/leading variables
Variables that correspond to a pivot
Basic variables have an exact value for a solution set

Free variables
Variables that do not correspond to any pivots and pivot columns
Can be assigned any value for a consistent linear system

Overdetermined system
# of rows > # of columns
System of linear equations with more equations than unknowns
Can be consistent
Can have a unique solution

Underdetermined system
# of columns > # of rows
System of linear equations with more unknowns than equations
Can never have a unique solution (always a free variable)
If the system is consistent -> infinite solutions
If the system is inconsistent -> no solution

Key Notes
Echelon Form of a Matrix
3 Properties:
1. All zero rows are at the bottom
2. Each leading entry (non-zero entry) of a row is to the right of any leading entries in the row above it (if any)
3. Below a leading entry, all entries are 0

RREF
All leading entries are 1’s
There are 0’s above and below each leading 1
A matrix can be in neither echelon form nor RREF
This means that more row reduction needs to be done

Uniqueness of the RREF
Each matrix is row equivalent (has the same solution set) to one and only one reduced echelon matrix
A matrix has only one RREF matrix
Inconsistent systems have empty solution sets

Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
A linear system is consistent if and only if the rightmost column of the augmented matrix is not a pivot column
No row of the form:
[0 0 0 0 0 | b] with b non-zero
If a linear system is consistent, the solution set has either:
Unique solution (no free variables)
Infinitely many solutions (at least one free variable)
